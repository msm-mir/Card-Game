# 🃏 Castle Game

This project is a card game named **Castle** implemented in **C++**, as part of an Advanced Programming course.

## 📋 Description

The game is based on an object-oriented programming (OOP) using classes such as card and player. Each player receives random cards and earns points based on the type of cards they hold.

- The game starts by asking for each player's name and the maximum score to reach.
- Each player is dealt 3 random cards per turn.
- The game continues until one of the players reaches the target score.
- At the end of the game, the winner's name and score are displayed first, followed by the scores of the other players.
